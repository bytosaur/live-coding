# Szenenwechsel 27.10.23

For the presentation of [ZKMs new program for 2024](https://zkm.de/de/veranstaltung/2023/10/szenenwechsel)
under a new head, we are doing a live-coding show for visuals. The focus will be
on media that is associated with ZKMs past, symbolizing the end of a golden era. 
This media may be:
- images [posters, ZKM website (old and new), Logos, Books]
- video [YouTube, LiveStream]

### Aesthetics
Since it is a dance party the attention span of the visitors is much shorter compared to
a concert. Hence, we want to focus on flashy lights and drastic and
abrupt changes in the visuals. Furthermore, we will focus on glitches.
We do not want to rely on video feedback too much.

The work could be constructed using three types of layers in the following order
(lowest first): feedback loop, video and flashing images. Each layer should have
a control to modify its visibility and expressiveness.

#### Feedback Loop

#### Video

#### Flashing Images
The main concern will be the flashing display of the images. We want to react to
the music and insert some controllable randomness.

#### Other Elements
- diagonal stripes symbolizing ZKM and HFG

#### Colors
Color schemes:
- black & white (new)
- green & orange (old)
- given colors
